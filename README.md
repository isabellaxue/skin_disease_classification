# Melanoma Detection:&nbsp; Deep learning&nbsp;image Classification

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wanderdust/skin-lesion-analysis-toward-melanoma-detection

Objective: develop a deep learning model for diagnosing melanoma skin cancer using skin lesion images, as distinguishing between seborrheic keratosis, melanoma, and nevus based on visual appearance can be challenging for the general public.

Goal: The goal is to build a robust and reliable deep learning model that can accurately classify skin lesion images, enabling early detection and diagnosis of melanoma, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the need for unnecessary invasive procedures.

Significance: The significance of this project lies in its potential to assist dermatologists and medical professionals in accurately diagnosing skin cancer through automated image analysis. In addition, the proposed solution could be used to help the general public understand their conditions before deciding to see a medical professionals.
